# Chef Bot - Development Documentation

## Project Overview
Chef Bot is an AI-powered recipe suggestion web application that helps users discover recipes based on their available ingredients.

## Quick Start
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment variables
# Create .env file with:
CHEFBOT_API_KEY=your_deepseek_api_key

# Run the application
python app.py
```

## Development Guidelines

### Code Structure
- `app.py`: Main Flask application entry point
- `chatbot.py`: DeepSeek integration and recipe suggestion logic
- `database.py`: Database models and operations
- `config.py`: Configuration settings and environment variables
- `models/`: Database models
- `templates/`: HTML templates
- `static/`: CSS, JavaScript, and other static files

### Coding Standards
1. **Python Style Guide**
   - Follow PEP 8 guidelines
   - Use type hints for function parameters and returns
   - Document all functions with docstrings

2. **Git Workflow**
   - Create feature branches from `develop`
   - Branch naming: `feature/feature-name`, `bugfix/bug-name`
   - Commit messages should be clear and descriptive
   - Pull requests require code review before merging

3. **Testing Requirements**
   - Unit tests for all core functionality
   - Integration tests for API endpoints
   - UI/UX testing for frontend components
   - Test coverage should be >80%

### QA Checkpoints
Each feature must pass these checks before approval:

#### Backend Checks
- [ ] API endpoints follow RESTful conventions
- [ ] Error handling is implemented
- [ ] Input validation is in place
- [ ] Database queries are optimized
- [ ] API responses are properly formatted

#### Frontend Checks
- [ ] UI is responsive on all screen sizes
- [ ] Form validation works correctly
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly
- [ ] Loading states are handled
- [ ] Browser compatibility tested

#### Security Checks
- [ ] API keys are properly secured
- [ ] Input sanitization is implemented
- [ ] SQL injection prevention is in place
- [ ] XSS protection is implemented
- [ ] CSRF protection is enabled

### Deployment Process
1. Run all tests
2. Update version number
3. Create release branch
4. Deploy to staging
5. Perform QA testing
6. Deploy to production

## API Documentation

### Ingredient Management
```
GET /api/ingredients

## Version Control
```bash
# Initialize repository
git init

# Create develop branch
git checkout -b develop

# Before pushing changes
git add .
git commit -m "descriptive message"
git push origin develop

# Create release
git checkout -b release/v1.0.0
```

## Quality Gates
Each PR must pass:
1. Automated tests
2. Code coverage requirements
3. Code review by senior developer
4. Security scan
5. Performance benchmarks
